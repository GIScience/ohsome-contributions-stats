= Candidate databases for analytical use cases

Both, the microservice movement and principal considerations in the realm of big data processing, have emphasized the trend to use a dedicated database for every use case.
While there used to be central database servers shared by many services within an organization the focus is now on more independence / lower schema-coupling through separate instances.
The availability of many different open-source databases also made it possible to use the best-suited database for a given task ("Unbundling the Database").
The smaller scope of a database decision also helps to reduce the risk of strong coupling to a (potentially poorly chosen) database.

However, it is also clear that an organization can only be proficient in a limited number of database technologies, so care should still be taken not to use _too many_ different database systems without proper justification.

== Important architectual critera

The decision for a particular database technology and product has many facets.
In the following we list a number of criteria which can aid the selection.
As we are planning for a read-heavy system with analytical queries some of these criteria become more important than they would be for more transactional workloads.


=== Overall complexity

* low: in-process
* medium: classic client-server (or cloud-managed cluster )
* high: self-managed cluster


=== Query language

* SQL
* proprietary language


=== Type

* OLTP: transactional, row-oriented workloads
* OLAP: analytical, read-heavy, column-oriented workloads
* HTAP: hybrid OLTP and OLAP


=== Scaling

* vertical (bigger machine)
* horizontal (more machines)
* read replication (write to 1 machine, read from many)


=== Spatial support

* none
* limited (basic spatial indexes, data types, and function )
* full (e.g. PostGIS)


=== JDBC support

* yes
* no

=== Support for extensions / UDF

* based on SQL
* based on external programming language

=== Time-Series Support

* minimal
* basic
* extended (automatic aggregations)

== Selected Candidates

The following table gives a very brief overview of possible databases for analytical use cases, such as the HOT OSM stats services.
