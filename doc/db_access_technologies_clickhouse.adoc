= Database access technologies for ClickHouse

In the Java ecosystem, almost all databases can be accessed via JDBC.
In many situations, however,
it is useful to employ an additional library or framework on top of raw JDBC interfaces.

The following table provides a brief overview of the major options.

|===


While all of these libraries can be used for writing to and reading from databases,
the primary concern is support for queries.
The data ingestion might also be accomplished by an existing connector,
i.e. Kafka, Spark, or Flink sink connector.
