# ohsome Contributions Stats
The goal of this project is to quantify the changes that are happening to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database every minute. As such, this project will provide:
1) overview statistics for mapping campaigns and hot tasking manager projects for a given time range
2) up-to-date statistics about OSM contributions during and shortly after mapathons
